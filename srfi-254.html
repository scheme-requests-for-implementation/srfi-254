    <h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

    <p>This SRFI describes three concepts associated with the storage
      management of a Scheme system, <i>ephemerons</i>, <i>guardians</i>, and
    <i>transport cell guardians</i>.</p>

    <p>
      An ephemeron is a record structure with a <i>key</i> and a <i>value</i> field.
      An ephemeron can be </i>broken</i>.  Breaking an ephemeron replaces the
      key and value with <code>#f</code>.  An implementation of this SRFI
      breaks an ephemeron when it proves that the storage occupied by
      the key could be reclaimed if the ephemeron were broken.
    </p>

    <p>
      A guardian is a structure containing objects as <i>guarded</i> or
      <i>resurrected</i> elements.  Initially, guardians are empty.
      Objects can be added in guarded elements to the guardian by the
      programmer.  An implementation of this SRFI resurrects an
      element when it proves that the storage occupied by
      the object could be reclaimed if all guardians in the system
      were empty.  Objects from resurrected elements can be queried
      and removed from the guardian by the programmer.  Instead of the
      object itself, a <i>representative</i> can be returned.
    </p>

    <p>
      A transport cell guardian is a structure containing <i>transport
        cells</i>, similar to a guardian.  Whenever an object in a
      guarded transport cell in the transport cell guardian is
      moved by the garbage collector, the transport cell is resurrected
      so that it can be queried by the programmer.
    </p>

    <h2 id="issues">Issues</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Include examples.</li>
      <li>Write tests.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="rationale">Rationale</h2>

    <p>Neither ephemerons nor guardians can be implemented portably in
      existing standard Scheme, so incorporating them as a standard
      features in Scheme implementations makes Scheme more expressive,
      and more portable programs possible.
    </p>

    <p>Ephemerons and guardians have been implemented in many Scheme
      systems and are incorporated in other programming languages as
      well, so their is sufficient experience both in terms of use
      cases and implementability with those features.
    </p>

    <p>Transport cell guardians are trivial to implement in Scheme
      systems with non-moving garbage collectors.  In Scheme systems
      with moving garbage collections, transport cell guardians or an
      equally powerful concept are needed to when hash values are to
      be derived from object addresses.
    </p>

    <p>Use cases for ephemerons are portable implementations of hash
      tables that hold the keys or the associated values or both
      weakly.</p>

    <p>A use case for guardians is the management of externally
      allocated resources that need to be eventually freed when all
      Scheme objects referencing them have been conceptually destroyed
      by the garbage collector.</p>

    <p>Use cases for transport cell guardians are efficient portable
      implementations of <code>eq?</code>-based hashing data structures.
    </p>

    <p>
      This SRFI
      supersedes <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-246/srfi-246.html">SRFI
      246</a>.  It is recommended that it
      supersede <a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-124/srfi-124.html">SRFI
      124</a> as well, and that SRFI 124 be withdrawn.  This
      SRFI renames the datum field of SRFI 124's ephemerons to value
      field because a datum in Scheme is a particular type of value.
    </p>

    <h2 id="specification">Specification</h2>

    <p>This SRFI extends the reports on Scheme by stipulating that
      locations can be <dfn>strongly holding</dfn> and <dfn>weakly
        holding</dfn>.  Except as noted, all newly chosen locations are
      strongly holding.</p>

    <p>As specified in the reports on Scheme, implementations of
      Scheme are required to be properly tail-recursive.  The formal
      definition of proper tail-recursion can be found
      in <cite><a href="#clinger">[2]</a></cite>.  This SRFI extends
      the property tail recursive semantics in <cite>[2]</cite> by replacing the last line
      <blockquote>
        and <var>&beta;</var>, &hellip; do not occur
        within <var>v</var>, <var>&rho;</var>, <var>&kappa;</var>, <var>&sigma;</var>
      </blockquote>
      in the garbage collection rule with
      <blockquote>
        and <var>&beta;</var>, &hellip; do not occur
        within <var>v</var>, <var>&rho;</var>, <var>&kappa;</var>, <var>&sigma;'</var>
        where <var>&sigma;</var>
        = <var>&sigma;'</var>[<var>&beta;'</var>, &hellip;
        &mapsto; <var>v''</var>, &hellip;] and <var>&beta;'</var> are
        weakly holding.
      </blockquote>
    </p>

    <p>This SRFI further stipulates that locations and sequences of
      locations can be <dfn>kept live</dfn> in the course of a
      computation.
    </p>

    <p>Finally, it stipulates that objects may be <dfn>moved</dfn> in
      the course of a computation with the following restriction: If
      an object <var>obj<sub>1</sub></var> is moved, every
      object <var>obj<sub>2</sub></var> such that <code>eq?</code>
      returns <code>#t</code> when applied
      to <var>obj<sub>1</sub></var> and <var>obj<sub>2</sub></var> is moved as well.
    <p>

    <h3>Ephemerons</h3>

    <p>The procedures in this section are exported by the <code>(srfi
        :254 ephemerons-and-guardians ephemerons)</code> library.  The
        procedure <code>reference-barrier</code> is also exported by
        the <code>(srfi :254 ephemerons-and-guardians guardians)
        library</code>.
    </p>

    <p>An <dfn>ephemeron</dfn> is a record structure with two fields
      called the <dfn>key</dfn> and <dfn>value</dfn> fields.  The
      content of the key field is stored in a weakly holding
      location.</p>

    <p>Ephemerons can be <dfn>broken</dfn>.  When an ephemeron is
      broken, the contents of its value field are replaced
      with <code>#f</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the content of an ephemeron's key field denotes a location or
      a sequence of locations, the ephemeron is broken in the course
      of the computation if the garbage collector would reclaim the
      location or sequence of locations if the location denoted by the
      ephemeron's value field were weakly holding.  The ephemeron may
      be broken in the course of a computation if the Scheme
      implementation can prove that the location or sequence of
      locations will not be kept live in the future of the computation
      if the ephemeron is broken.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>reference-barrier</strong> <var>obj</var></p>

    <p>If <var>obj</var> is an object such as a pair, string, vector,
      or bytevector that denotes a location or a sequence of
      locations, the location or the sequence of locations is kept
      live.
    </p>

    <p><i>Comment:</i> Other procedures may keep locations live as
      well.</p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>make-ephemeron</strong> <var>key</var> <var>value</var></p>

    <p>The <code>make-ephemeron</code> procedure returns a newly
      allocated ephemeron with fields <var>key</var>, which should
      denote a location or a sequence of locations,
      and <var>value</var>.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>ephemeron?</strong> <var>object</var></p>

    <p>The <code>ephemeron?</code> procedure returns <code>#t</code>
      if its argument is an ephemeron, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>ephemeron-key</strong> <var>ephemeron</var></p>

    <p>The <code>ephemeron-key</code> procedure returns the contents
      of the key field of <var>ephemeron</var> if the ephemeron hasn't
      been broken, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>ephemeron-value</strong> <var>ephemeron</var></p>

    <p>The <code>ephemeron-value</code> procedure returns the contents
      of the value field of <var>ephemeron</var>.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>ephemeron-broken?</strong> <var>ephemeron</var></p>

    <p>The <code>ephemeron-broken?</code> procedure
      returns <code>#t</code> if <var>ephemeron</var> has been broken,
      and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>Guardians</h3>

    <p>The procedures of this section are exported by the <code>(srfi
        :254 ephemerons-and-guardians guardians) library</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Guardians first appeared in <cite><a href="dybvig">[3]</a></cite>.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>guardian</dfn> is a heterogenous structure with two
      types of elements, <dfn>guarded</dfn> elements
      and <dfn>resurrected</dfn> elements.  A guarded element is
      a record structure with two fields called the <dfn>object</dfn>
      and the <dfn>representative</dfn> field.  A resurrected
      element contains a single value.
    </p>

    <p>A guarded element of a guardian can be <dfn>resurrected</dfn>.
      When a guarded element is resurrected, the guarded element is
      removed from the guardian and a resurrected element containing
      the content of the representative field of the removed guarded
      element is added to the guardian.
    </p>

    <p>If the object of a guarded element denotes a location or a
      sequence of locations, the element is resurrected in the
      course of the computation when the garbage collector would
      reclaim the location or sequence of locations if all locations
      denoted by the fields of guarded elements or by resurrected
      elements of all guardians were weakly resurrected.  The element
      may be resurrected in the course of a computation if the
      Scheme implementation can prove that the location or sequence of
      locations will not be kept live in the future of the computation
      if the element is resurrected.
    </p>

    <p>
      Guardians are represented by a Scheme
      procedures <var>guardian</var>.  When <var>guardian</var> is
      invoked on two Scheme values <var>obj</var> and <var>rep</var>,
      where <var>obj</var> should denote a location or a sequence of
      locations and <var>rep</var> should not be <code>#f</code>, a
      guarded element whose object field contains <var>obj</var>
      and whose representative field contains <var>rep</var> is added
      to the guardian.
    </p>

    <p>When <var>guardian</var> is invoked on no
      arguments, a resurrected element, if available, is removed from
      the guardian and its contents returned.  If no resurrected
      element is available, <code>#f</code> is returned.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>make-guardian</strong></p>

    <p>The <code>make-guardian</code> procedure returns a newly
      allocated guardian, initially with no elements.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>guardian?</strong> <var>obj</var></p>

    <p>The <code>guardian?</code> procedure returns <code>#t</code> if
      its argument is a guardian, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <h3>Transport Cell Guardians</h3>

    <p>The procedures of this section are exported by the <code>(srfi
        :254 ephemerons-and-guardians transport-cell-guardians) library</code>.
    </p>

    <p>Transport (link) cells first appeared in <cite><a href="ghuloum">[1]</a></cite>.</p>

    <p>A <dfn>transport cell</dfn> is a record structure with two
      fields called the <dfn>key</dfn> and <dfn>value</dfn> fields.
      The content of the key field is stored in a weakly holding
      location.
    </p>

    <p>Transport cells can be <dfn>broken</dfn>.  If the content of its key
      field denotes a location or a sequence of locations, the
      transport cell is broken in the course of the computation when the
      garbage collector reclaims the location or sequence of
      locations.  The transport cell may be broken in the course of a
      computation if the Scheme implementation can prove that the
      location or sequence of locations will not be kept alive in the
      future of the computation if the ephemeron is broken.
    </p>

    <p>A <dfn>transport cell guardian</dfn> is a homogeneous structure
      contain transport cells.
    </p>

    <p>
      Transport cell guardians are represented by Scheme
      procedures <var>guardian</var>.  When <var>guardian</var> is
      invoked on two Scheme values <var>key</var>
      and <var>value</var>, a transport cell with
      fields <var>key</var> and <var>value</var> is added
      to <var>guardian</var> and returned to the caller
      of <var>guardian</var>.
    </p>

    <p>When <var>guardian</var> is invoked on no arguments and it
      contains a transport cell whose key may have been moved since
      the transport cell was added to <var>guardian</var>, such a
      transport cell is removed from <var>guardian</var> and returned
      to the caller of <var>guardian</var>.  If <var>guardian</var>
      contains no such transport cell, <code>#f</code> is returned.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>current-hash</strong> <var>obj</var></p>

    <p>The <code>current-hash</code> procedure returns an exact
      integer. If objects <var>obj<sub>1</sub></var>
      and <var>obj<sub>2</sub></var> such that <code>eq?</code>
      returns <code>#t</code> when applied to these objects are not
      moved between an invocation of <code>current-hash</code>
      to <var>obj<sub>1</sub></var> and an invocation
      of <code>current-hash</code> to <var>obj<sub>2</sub></var>, both
      calls to <code>current-hash</code> return the same exact integer.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>make-transport-cell-guardian</strong></p>

    <p>
      The <code>make-transport-cell-guardian</code> procedure returns
      a newly allocated transport cell guardian, initially containing
      no transport cells.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>transport-cell-guardian?</strong> <var>obj</var></p>

    <p>The <code>transport-cell-guardian?</code> procedure returns <code>#t</code>
      if its argument is a transport cell guardian, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>transport-cell?</strong> <var>obj</var></p>

    <p>The <code>transport-cell?</code> procedure returns <code>#t</code>
      if its argument is a transport cell, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>transport-cell-key</strong> <var>transport-cell</var></p>

    <p>The <code>transport-cell-key</code> procedure returns the contents
      of the key field of <var>transport-cell</var> if the transport-cell hasn't
      been broken, and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>transport-cell-value</strong> <var>transport-cell</var></p>

    <p>Procedure: <strong>transport-cell-broken?</strong> <var>transport-cell</var></p>

    <p>The <code>transport-cell-broken?</code> procedure
      returns <code>#t</code> if <var>transport-cell</var> has been broken,
      and <code>#f</code> otherwise.
    </p>
